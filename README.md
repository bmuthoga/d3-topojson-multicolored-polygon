# D3.JS TopoJSON Polygon
This is a simple multicolored polygon built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

It is an alternative version of [this](https://github.com/bmuthoga/d3-geojson-multicolored-polygon), but using `topojson` instead of `geojson`

The app, and online editor, can also be found here on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3-topojson-multicolored-polygon-dueeg)

Below is a preview of how it looks like:
